<title>Shrubbot Conversion</title>

<para>
    This section is intended for server administrators migrating &project:name;
    from pre-2.1.0 to &project:version;.
    If you have already migrated or migration does not apply, you should skip this section.
</para>

<para>
    As of &project:name; 2.1.0 the data files have changed and are not compatible
    with older versions. In order to assist servers wanting to upgrade, we provide
    a &perl:name; script which can convert most (not all) of the data from old
    <command>shrubbot.cfg</command>
    to the newer <filename>.db</filename> formats.
</para>

<para>
    <note>
        The conversion script is written in &perl:name;.
        Most &linux:name;&osx:name; systems have this available and should be able to run the script.
        &windows:name; systems typically do not have &perl:name; available.
        You can either install &perl:name; yourself, or find someone else (maybe a friendly &linux:name;)
        whom you can trust and have run the script for you.
    </note>
    <warning>
        Upgrades are only supported from &project:name; 2.0.X to &project:title;.
        Older versions may not convert as expected.
    </warning>
</para>

<para>
    Data from <filename>shrubbot.cfg</filename>
    will be converted and placed into
    <filename>user.db</filename> and <filename>level.db</filename>.
    Other data found in <filename>.dat</filename> files is silently
    <emphasis role="bold">ignored</emphasis>
    and
    <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> converted.
</para>

<para>
    Admin, level and permanent-ban records are converted. Temporary-ban records are not converted.
</para>

    <para>
        Change to server's &project:name; directory as <command>convert_shrub</command>
            expects to find <filename>shrubbot.cfg</filename> in the current directory.
            Execute <command>convert_shrub</command>. The script usually has the correct file permissions
            and can find &perl:cmd; by itself on recent &linux:name; systems, but for our example
            we will explicitly run it from your shell path.

        <para>
            Examine the newly created <filename>.db</filename> files.
            The next time &project:name; server is launched it will read the files into memory.
            Then shutdown the server and the full (scrubbed) data will be written which is cleaner,
            and more rich than what <command>convert_shrub</command> can produce.

        <para>
            Rename <filename>shrubbot.cfg</filename>. This file is no longer required but is recommended
            to keep this file around if you want to compare the converted data.
            We rename it to show the file is no longer in use.
