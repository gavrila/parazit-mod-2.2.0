    <term>g_censor</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
        With release 2.1.0 and higher, <varname>g_censor</varname> is no longer
        a comma-separated list of words, and has changed to accept either
        { 0, 1 } to respectively { disable, enable } the censor feature.
    </para>
    <para>
        The words list is now read from a <filename>censor.db</filename> located in the &project:name; directory.
        There is no practical limit to the number of words you can enter into this file.
        &project:name; expects <emphasis role="bold">one</emphasis> word per line, such as:

<screen>word1 
word2 
word3

<varlistentry>
    <term>g_xpSave</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
        With release 2.1.0 and higher, <varname>g_xpSave</varname> no longer specifies a filename
        and has changed to accept { 0, 1 } to respectively { disable, enable } the XP-save feature.
        The reason for this is that XP data is now integrated into <filename>users.db</filename>.
