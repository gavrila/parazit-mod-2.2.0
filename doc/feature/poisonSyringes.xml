    Poison syringes are added to weapon slot #4 (behind grenades).
    It is a blue colored syringe that you can poke enemies with (or friendlies when friendly-fire enabled).
    When poked with a poison syringe, your view will start swaying back and forth, and get distorted.
    You can hear your heart pounding. Better find help.

    Compounding effect - that is, if you are poked multiple times, you loose health faster.
    This allows XP sharing with poison hits â€“ if you poke someone with a poison syringe,
    you will get XP for every time damage is dealt until they die.
    The interval of time that your syringe damages the player is 1.5 seconds,
    so every 1.5 seconds you will get 0.2 Medic XP and hurt the player 10HP.
    Since it tracks multiple people hitting the player with a Poison Syringe,
    the last poison damage inflicted that causes the death of the player gives
    the person who hit them with the specific syringe that caused the death a final 3 Medic XP.

    Poisoned players can be cured with health packs.
    However, in an effort to make the game more balanced, medics cannot self-antidote.
    Essentially, a player can antidote themselves by finding a health pack that is not their own.
    Since poison compounds, you must find a health pack for each time you have been poisoned.
    For example, if you have been poked 4 times with a syringe, you must find 4 health packs.
    <tip>
        Health cabinets provide a good source of health packs.
