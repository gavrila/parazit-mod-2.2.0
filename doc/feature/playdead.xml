    Playdead allows a player to fake being dead in the hopes an attacker will give
    them no further attention and kindly move on.
    You can use this feature by binding a key for it in the in-game &project:name; menu under Misc.
    The key you specify will toggle playdead mode.

    When you are in playdead mode, you cannot shoot your weapon.
    To an enemy, you look like a dead player (after a tap-out and awaiting a respawn).
    However, you will still be a solid body (players cannot walk through you) and your eyes will still blink.
    <note>
        Note that this version of playdead is a bit less bugged than &shrub:name;’s version.
        It’s much harder to get stuck in walls, and there’s just about zero chance
        of someone using this as an exploit to get through a wall
        (example, bank doors on Goldrush) due to extra checks to make sure there is
        enough clearance for your player to fall down and still be in the “world”.

        This is an excellent way to infiltrate enemy bases and maintain the element of surprise!
